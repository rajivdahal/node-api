database modeling for e-ceommerce
file folders has changed and with the influence of react you will create component folter inside the root directory
->components
  ->entity1(products)
  ->users
etc.
inside each entity make file for each of them like
inside users
 user.controller.js
 user.query.js
 user.route.js
 user.model.js


 now start for the database modeling with mongoose
 inside products.model.js

route is made for product file and each routes are assigned as according
flow is app.js-> products.route.js-> to products.controller.js->products.querry.js (for products)

promise is created in query because to end request response cycle next() scope is only in controller and 
it must end req. response cycle for error thus to manipulate errors promise is created

and handled as according in products.controller.js
