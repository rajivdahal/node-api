the gist thing here is seperation of concern
you have model,view and controller and controllers are seperated for different entities
you need to route wach of the endpoint to their own controller 
step1: in app,js dont make too dirty
simply use below code by importing authrouter

const authrouter=require('./Controllers/auth.controller')
   app.use('/auth',authrouter)

whenever a client hit /auth it will redirect to authrouter and inside authrouter for /auth/login or bla bla end point make seperate middleware
as made 

ther might be the endpoint not registered 
to catch error 
make a simple application level middleware art last whenever the endpoint wont match to other it will send 404 error



app.use(function(req,res,next){
    res.json({
        msg:"endpoint not found",
        status:404
    })
})


if you keep this middle upper to      app.use('/auth',authrouter)    

first the normal level middleware will execute and always throws an error so always keep normal app. level middleware at the bottom 
for error handling
